    "# Lightcurves of Transiting Exoplanets\n",

    "#### By [Dr. Daniel Apai](http://apai.space) and [Dr. Ben Rackham](http://rackham.space)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In  this  activity  we  will  explore  how  some  extrasolar  planets  can  be  discovered  and characterized by precisely measuring the brightness of their host stars. When planets pass in front of their host stars (as seen from Earth) they cover part of the host star’s disk — making it look  a  tiny  bit  fainter.  These  events  are  called **planetary  transits**.  The  slight  dimming  has  a characteristic shape and Project EDEN searches for such events to find the planets that cause them.  NASA’s  Kepler  Space  Observatory  has  used  exoplanet  transit  events  to  identify  over 4,000 new extrasolar planets – the largest bounty of new worlds ever!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how transits can be analyzed — not only to identify the presence of a planet, but  also  to  learn  about  its  basic  properties:  size,  orbital  period,  and  —  with  some  additional information — density and likely composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First let’s clarify a few key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lightcurve:** a figure that shows the brightness of an object (here the host star) over time. For a typical star, this would be a flat line: the star is always the same brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transit Event:** an event during which a planet passes in front of its host star (as seen from Earth), blocking a fraction of light from star and causing it to appear dimmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transit Depth:** the maximum brightness difference between the in-transit and out-of-transit brightness of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ingress:** The first stage of the transit, during which only part of the planet is only obscuring the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Egress:** The final stage of the transit, during which only part of the planet is only obscuring the star."
